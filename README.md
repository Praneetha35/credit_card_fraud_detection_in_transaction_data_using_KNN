# Credit Card Fraud Detection in Transaction Data using KNN

This project applies the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It explores the use of k-NN on a high-dimensional, imbalanced dataset, aiming to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing both false positives and false negatives.

## Key Objectives
- Implement the k-NN algorithm for fraud detection in credit card transactions.
- Address challenges associated with an imbalanced dataset.
- Optimize the model to minimize errors in fraud classification.

## Preprocessing and Model Implementation
The project covers the preprocessing steps needed to handle the imbalanced nature of the dataset, including:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Feature scaling to ensure model accuracy.
- Balancing the dataset using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling.

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions and avoid false positives.

## Challenges and Insights
The project discusses key challenges such as:
- Handling the class imbalance in the dataset.
- Selecting optimal values for k to improve detection performance.
- Ensuring the model generalizes well on unseen data.

It also provides insights into how k-NN can be applied to real-world fraud detection tasks, highlighting the trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability.

## Conclusion
The k-NN algorithm proves to be an effective tool for credit card fraud detection, but it requires careful consideration of dataset preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. The insights gained from this project can be applied to improve fraud detection systems in financial institutions.
